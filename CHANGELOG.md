# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- CRM works on its own: it depends on the platform's `contacts`, `parties` and `products` instead
  of ERP's selling. Contacts and addresses moved to the platform's `contacts` package, with their
  hooks; CRM adds their lead and prospect links and the address rule.
- The connector app `crm-erp` (package `crm_erp`, shipped with CRM and offered where ERP is
  installed) brings what needs ERP: quotations' tax templates and taxes, "Create Sales Order", and
  the sales orders' link to their quotation. Requires the platform 0.3.2 (`column: true` overlays).
- Declares where it keeps people's personal data, so Administration → Personal data exports and
  erases it for a person (by email).
- Quotation lines can be in any of the item's units; orders made from them keep the unit, and an
  order line in another unit counts against the quoted quantity through stock units.

## 0.1.0

- First release as a standalone Ferrum app (previously part of the Ferrum repository).
